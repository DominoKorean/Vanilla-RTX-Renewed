You can do whatever you want with my texture pack, screenshots, videos, modifications for personal use or redistribution, as long as you don't sell it and provide a link to this page or my Patreon page. Oh, and also, don't mix it with Realistico. Dead serious. Absolutely not a joke. This is not irony, I really insist. I will sue you.
